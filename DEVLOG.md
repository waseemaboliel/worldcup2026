## API Reference

### FIFA APIs

| Data | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| All 104 matches (EN) | `https://api.fifa.com/api/v3/calendar/matches?language=en-GB&idCompetition=17&idSeason=285023&count=104` |
| All 104 matches (AR) | `https://api.fifa.com/api/v3/calendar/matches?language=ar-SA&idCompetition=17&idSeason=285023&count=104` |
| Match timeline | `https://api.fifa.com/api/v3/timelines/17/285023/{IdStage}/{IdMatch}?language=en-GB` |
| Match lineup (FIFA) | `https://api.fifa.com/api/v3/live/football/17/285023/{IdStage}/{IdMatch}?language=en-GB` |
| Israel TV channels | `https://api.fifa.com/api/v3/watch/season/285023?language=en-GB` |

**Key facts:**
- `MatchStatus`: `0` = finished, `1` = upcoming
- `IdStage`: group stage = `289273`, R32 = `289287`, R16 = `289288`, QF = `289289`, SF = `289290`, Final = `289291`
- 12 groups (A–L), `IdGroup` from `289275` to `289286`
- `BallPossession` field exists in match API but is always `null` — FIFA does not expose it
- No dedicated standings or scorers API — computed from match/timeline data

**Timeline event types:**
| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Goal |
| 1 | Assist (appears just before its Goal event) |
| 2 | Yellow card |
| 3 | Red card |
| 5 | Substitution |
| 57 | Goal Prevention (save) — `IdPlayer` is always the goalkeeper |

**Flag emoji:**
- FIFA 3-letter codes mapped to ISO alpha-2 via `FIFA_TO_ALPHA2` in `app.js`
- Base codepoint must be `0x1F1E6` (not `0x1F1E0`)
- Special cases: `HAI`→`HT`, `SCO`→🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 tag emoji, `CUW`→`CW`, `CPV`→`CV`, `COD`→`CD`

### ESPN Public API (no key required)

| Purpose | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| All 104 event IDs | `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/soccer/fifa.world/scoreboard?dates=20260611-20260719&limit=200` |
| Match lineup + formation | `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/soccer/fifa.world/summary?event={espnId}` |

**ESPN roster fields per player:**
| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `starter` | true = starting XI |
| `jersey` | shirt number |
| `athlete.displayName` | full name |
| `position.abbreviation` | granular position: `G`, `LB`, `RB`, `CD-L`, `CD-R`, `LM`, `RM`, `CM-L`, `CM-R`, `CF-L`, `CF-R`, `F` etc. |
| `formationPlace` | pitch slot 1–11; lower numbers = further right within a line |
| `formation` (team level) | e.g. `"4-4-2"` — matches actual tactical setup ✅ |

**Important ESPN quirks:**
- `CM-L`/`CM-R` and `CF-L`/`CF-R` denote foot preference, NOT lateral position — don't sort by suffix
- `formationPlace` is not grouped by row — use position bucket to assign rows, then `formationPlace` descending for left-to-right order within ambiguous positions
- FWD sub-rows (e.g. shadow strikers in `3-4-2-1`): slice by `formationPlace` descending (higher fp = closer to midfield = shadow striker row)

## What's Built

### Phase 1 — Shell ✅ (2026-06-12)
- `index.html` with dark theme, Inter font, CSS design tokens
- Sticky nav: trophy emoji, title, subtitle
- Match card: flags, team names, kickoff time or score, venue, badge
- Fully responsive — single column mobile, 680px desktop

### Phase 2 — Match List ✅ (2026-06-12)
- Fetches all 104 matches on page load
- Loading spinner + error state
- Grouped by date in Israel timezone (`Asia/Jerusalem`)
- Upcoming: kickoff time, group badge | Finished: score, PSO if applicable, FT badge

### Phase 3 — Match Detail Panel ✅ (2026-06-12)
- Click card → expands inline with fadeIn animation; one card open at a time
- Finished matches: timeline fetched on demand; `timelineCache` Map prevents re-fetching
- Goals with assists, yellow/red cards, substitutions
- Attendance shown at top
- Upcoming matches: "No match details yet"
- Two-column layout: home events always LEFT, minute CENTRE, away events always RIGHT — `direction: ltr` hardcoded so it never flips in RTL. In RTL columns swap so events stay under the correct team

### Phase 4 — Tabs, Standings, Stats, Filters ✅ (2026-06-12)
- Tabs: Matches / Standings / Stats; filter chips + search visible only on Matches tab
- Group standings computed from match scores (no API); 12 groups sorted by Pts → GD → GF; top 2 highlighted green
- Stats tab: Player Stats (Goals, Assists, Clean Sheets, Yellow, Red) + Team Stats (Goals/Game, Conceded/Game, Clean Sheets, Yellow, Red)
- Stage filter chips: All / Groups / R32 / R16 / QF / SF / Final — filter by `IdStage` (language-independent)
- Team search: live, case-insensitive, combines with stage filter

### Phase 5 — Israel TV, PWA, UX Polish ✅ (2026-06-12)
- Israel TV channels shown on every match card (Kan Box always shown green; dedup KAN/KAN 11 and MAKAN/MAKAN 33)
- Auto-scroll to today's date group on load; today label shown in gold
- PWA: `manifest.json` + `sw.js` (cache shell for offline/fast load)

### Phase 6 — Extended Stats ✅ (2026-06-12)
- Player Stats: top scorers, assists, clean sheets (originally from timeline heuristic, replaced in Phase 8b), yellow/red card leaders
- Team Stats: 5 sub-tabs, first 3 from match scores, cards from timelines

### Phase 7 — Multi-language: English / Hebrew / Arabic ✅ (2026-06-13)

**Language support:**
| | English | Hebrew | Arabic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Team names | API `en-GB` | `TEAM_NAME_HE` map | API `ar-SA` |
| Stadium / City / Group | API `en-GB` | API `en-GB` (no Hebrew endpoint) | API `ar-SA` |
| Stage badges | `STRINGS.en` | `STRINGS.he` | `STRINGS.ar` |
| UI text | `STRINGS.en` | `STRINGS.he` | `STRINGS.ar` |
| Date headings | `en-GB` locale | `he-IL` locale | `ar-SA` locale |
| Timeline descriptions | API `en-GB` | API `en-GB` | API `en-GB` (Arabic unparseable) |
| Page direction | LTR | RTL | RTL |

- **Toggle:** `EN / עב / عر` buttons right-pinned in nav; `localStorage` persistence; `dir`/`lang` set on `<html>`; nav always LTR (`direction: ltr` on `.nav-inner`)
- **String system:** `STRINGS` object + `t(key, ...args)` helper; covers all UI strings with Hebrew and Arabic translations
- **Arabic match data:** `allMatchesAr` fetched in parallel on load; `activeMatches()` routes to AR data when Arabic active
- **Hebrew team names:** `TEAM_NAME_HE` map (48+ teams keyed by FIFA 3-letter code); `getTeamName()` uses it when `currentLang === 'he'`
- **Hebrew content:** dates via `he-IL` locale (`Intl`); stage badges translated in all 3 languages; `text-transform: uppercase` suppressed in RTL
- **RTL layout:** `[dir="rtl"]` overrides for match card border, team row direction, standings alignment, filter chip scroll, scorer labels

### Phase 8 — Lineups, Pitch View & Clean Sheet Fix ✅ (2026-06-13)

- **Phase 8a — Lineup fetch & cache:** `fetchTimeline` + `fetchLineup` (FIFA) + `fetchEspnLineup` (ESPN) all run in `Promise.all` — zero extra latency. `lineupCache` + `espnLineupCache` Maps prevent re-fetching. FIFA lineup normalised to `{ formation, coach, starters[], subs[] }` with `{ id, name, shirt, position(0-3) }` per player. ESPN lineup normalised to same shape with additional `posAbbr` and `formationPlace`.
- **Phase 8b — Clean sheet fix:** `renderCleanSheets` now uses `fetchLineup` (FIFA) per match; starting GK = `starters.find(p => p.position === 0)`. Keyed by `IdPlayer` so different GKs across matches accumulate separately. No more `[Team] GK` fallback.
- **Phase 8c — ESPN bridge:** `fetchEspnIndex()` fetches all 104 ESPN event IDs once on load, builds `fifaToEspn` Map (`IdMatch → espnEventId`) by matching date + normalised team names. 72/72 named matches bridge correctly. `ESPN_NAME_MAP` handles FIFA↔ESPN name discrepancies (IR Iran, Cabo Verde, Czechia, Türkiye, etc.).
- **Phase 8d — Pitch view:** Green CSS pitch, away team in top half (GK at top, FWD towards centre), home team in bottom half (FWD towards centre, GK at bottom) — teams face each other. Formation string parsed into row sizes (`"3-4-2-1"` → `[1,3,4,2,1]`). Players assigned to rows by position bucket (GK/DEF/MID/FWD), then formation string splits MID and FWD into sub-rows. Within each row: `lateralSort()` uses `lateralOrder(posAbbr)` for unambiguous positions (LB=0, CD-L=1, CD-R=3, RB=4) with `formationPlace` descending as tiebreaker (lower fp = further right in ESPN's scheme). FWD sub-rows sliced by descending fp so shadow strikers (higher fp) appear in their own row above the lone striker. Substitutes shown in two columns below the pitch (home left, away right). Falls back silently if no lineup data available.

## Known Bugs (all fixed)

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| Arabic timeline showed raw Arabic descriptions instead of player names | Always fetch timelines in `en-GB`; section titles translated via `t()` |
| Stats leaderboards empty in Arabic | Stats always use EN timelines (name parsing relies on English regex) |
| Standings stuck loading in Arabic | Filter by `IdStage` (language-independent) instead of `StageName` string |
| Service worker error on `file://` | Guard `location.hostname !== ''` before SW registration |
| Manifest CORS error on `file://` | Inject `<link rel="manifest">` via JS only when `location.hostname` is truthy |
| GK clean sheet name showed as "[Team] GK" | Use FIFA lineup API; starter with `Position=0` is always the correct GK |

## Future Ideas

### Phase 9 — Match Stats Panel (ESPN) ✅ (2026-06-13)
Add a possession/shots/passes stats bar inside each finished match's expanded detail panel.

**What to show:** possession %, shots, shots on target, pass accuracy %, crosses, long balls, tackles, interceptions, clearances, fouls, yellow cards, red cards — all from `boxscore.teams[].statistics`.

**How to implement:**
- `fetchEspnLineup` already fetches `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/soccer/fifa.world/summary?event={espnId}` and the full response is available. Currently only `data.rosters` is used — also read `data.boxscore.teams` and store it alongside the lineup in `espnLineupCache` (add a `stats` field to the cached object, or cache separately as `espnStatsCache`).
- In `renderTimeline`, after the goals/cards/subs sections and before the lineup, render a "Match Stats" section. For each stat, render a two-value bar: home value — bar — away value (similar to how TV broadcasts show it). A simple CSS flex row works: `[home value] [label] [away value]` with a gradient bar between them showing proportional split.
- ESPN `statistics` entries have a `name` (machine key like `possessionPct`) and `displayValue` (already formatted string like `"54%"`). Use `displayValue` directly — no formatting needed.
- Only render the section if `espnStats` is non-null. Falls back silently (same pattern as lineup).
- Also read `boxscore.leaders` to add a "Top Performers" row: most shots, most passes, most saves — essentially a free mini man-of-the-match panel.

**No new API call needed** — the data is already in the ESPN summary response that is fetched per match on expand.

### Phase 10 — ESPN-Powered Stats Tab (full rebuild) ✨ HIGH PRIORITY
Replace the current stats tab (which painfully fetches 104 timelines and parses English regex) with ESPN structured data. ESPN's `boxscore` gives ready-to-use numbers per match for both players and teams.

**Data available from ESPN `summary` endpoint per match:**

| Source | Data |
|---|---|
| `boxscore.teams[].statistics` | possession %, shots, shots on target, passes, pass accuracy %, crosses, long balls, tackles, interceptions, clearances, fouls, yellow cards, red cards |
| `boxscore.rosters[].stats` | per-player match stats (shots, passes, tackles, etc.) |
| `boxscore.leaders` | top performer per category per match: totalShots, accuratePasses, defensiveInterventions, saves |

**Player stat leaderboards to build (aggregate across all matches):**
- Goals (keep from FIFA timeline — ESPN `leaders` doesn't aggregate goals cleanly)
- Assists (keep from FIFA timeline)
- Shots (total shots across tournament — from `rosters[].stats`)
- Shots on target
- Passes / pass accuracy
- Tackles / interceptions
- Saves (GK-specific)
- Yellow cards, Red cards

**Team stat leaderboards to build:**
- Possession % average
- Goals/game, Goals conceded/game (keep from FIFA match scores — already reliable)
- Shots/game, Shots on target/game
- Pass accuracy % average
- Tackles/game, Interceptions/game
- Clean sheets (keep from FIFA lineup API)
- Yellow cards, Red cards total

**How to implement:**
- On Stats tab open, iterate all finished matches that have an ESPN ID in `fifaToEspn`. For each, call `fetchEspnLineup` (already cached after first expand) — this returns the full summary. Accumulate `boxscore.teams[].statistics` per team and `boxscore.rosters[].stats` per player across all matches.
- For matches not yet expanded (no cache hit), fetch ESPN summary lazily — batch them with `Promise.allSettled` so one failure doesn't block the rest.
- Keep goals and assists sourced from FIFA timelines (they are already reliable and ESPN's goal data lives in the rosters/plays which is harder to aggregate cleanly).
- Replace the current 5 player sub-tabs and 5 team sub-tabs with the richer set above — or group them into "Attacking", "Defensive", "Discipline" sub-sections.

### Phase 11 — Live Match Updates
- Auto-refresh scores for in-progress matches (poll the matches API every ~60 seconds)
- Show a 🟢 LIVE badge on match cards when a match is in progress
- Update score and minute in real time without a full page reload
- Only poll when the Matches tab is active and at least one match is currently live

### Phase 12 — Knockout Bracket View
- New tab or sub-view showing the full tournament bracket from R32 onwards
- Visual bracket: each round as a column, matches connect winners left-to-right
- Completed matches show scores; upcoming show TBD with kickoff time
- Clicking a match in the bracket expands it (same detail panel as the Matches tab)

### Phase 13 — Player Profiles
- Tap any player name in the stats leaderboards or expanded match detail to open a profile
- Profile shows: flag, name, team, all goals / assists / cards across the tournament with match and minute
- Back button / close to return to previous view
- Data already available in `timelineCache` — no new API needed

### Phase 14 — Push Notifications (PWA)
- Alert users when a match they care about is about to kick off
- Use the Web Push API via the service worker
- Options: notify for all matches, or only bookmarked teams
- Requires a small backend (push subscription storage) — not purely static
